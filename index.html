    <p>
      For the past three years I've developed intuitive and accessible software
      applications in Typescript React and Vue. I have an eye for detail, a
      passion for excellence, and deep empathy for the user experience. I bring
      an additional four years of multi-discipline experience in QA, UX, Design,
      Product, and User Support. I lead and lift my cross functional teams with
      a deep care for my teammates, persevering through adversity and crushing
      our goals. Check out some examples of my work below!
